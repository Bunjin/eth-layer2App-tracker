# Eth Layer 2 APP Tracker 

A JS module for tracking Ethereum Layer 2 Apps

## Installation

`npm install eth-layer2App-tracker -S`


## Dev notes:

The specific sub layer2 package should be iframed and ran in a secure fashion with an API to communicate with metamask to perform some actions and also to provide the state to metamask.

Also the part that is currently in layer2App view of the metamask-extension should be iframed and made into a package specific to the layer2 App.

We also need to be able to inject the layer2app functions into the inpage
